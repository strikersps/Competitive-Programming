# Problem Statement: 
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index `i` of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at `i`.

For example:  
1.  Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  
    Expected output: `[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]`.  
2.  Input: `[3, 2, 1]`  
    Expected output: `[2, 3, 6]`.

Solve the problem without using division.
