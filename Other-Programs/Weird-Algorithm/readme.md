# Problem Statement
Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer `n`. If `n` is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if `n` is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until `n` is one.  
For example, the sequence for `n=3` is as follows:  
3→10→5→16→8→4→2→1

Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of `n`.

**Input**

The only input line contains an integer `n`.

**Output**

Print a line that contains all values of `n` during the algorithm.

**Constraints**  
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000  

**Example**  
Input:
3  
Output:
3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
